Target Practice:

The VR game that I have designed is a target practice simulator where the user can, with the push of a button, lauch a blue ball at a stationary target. 
The game is designed in 3D VR and thus the target can be found by moving the phone (and thus the head while wearing google cardboard). If a ball hits the target, 
then a score pops up above the target board. This score is on a scale of 0-10 and is 10 - distance of the ball from the center of the target. An additional part 
special about this development is that I used unity on Ubuntu 20 for the development which came with its own unique challenges that I had to resolve.

The final project apk is the file HelloCardboard/Builds/TargetCardboard1.apk

The app is a game because it has the funadamental aspects usually found in games -
1. A player - the user who wears the headset
2. Gameplay medium - The phone, or the google cardboard
3. Target - hitting the target as close to its center as possible
4. Rules - Clicking a button will launch a ball and moving your head will help to aim
5. Reward - The score, which is better the closer the ball hits the target
